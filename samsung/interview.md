# 自我介绍
hello, from now I will have a brief introduction of myself. 
My name is Jiakang Weng and I come from Xi'an. 

for bachlar, I stady communication engineering in XiDian University.
In Xidian, I not only learned a lot of communication-related knowledge, 
but also learned about analog integrated circuits, digital circuits and other hardware. I also got the postgraduate recommendation for Xi'dian University.

To broaden my horizon, I went to Techische Universtity Dresden to continue my studies in communication engineering, so I also can speak German.
In school I participated in the Germany 5G lab for intership and had the opportunity to participate in reseach article and project.

After that I was fortunate enough to complete a six-month internship in Huawei Cloud, 
where I worked as software engerineer in Huawei Gauss Database and mainly on storage kernel development.
Thats all, thanks for your attention.
